Astro Error Pages is a simple yet effective middleware for your Astro SSR (Server-Side Rendered) applications.
It provides you with a way to intercept server responses, analyze status codes, and redirect to custom error pages when necessary.
This functionality enables a more user-friendly error handling and overall smoother user experience.

## Installation

You can install Astro Error Pages via npm with the following command:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="npm">
    ```sh
    npm install astro-error-pages
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="yarn">
    ```sh
    yarn add astro-error-pages
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Setup

You'll need astro version 2.4 or higher to have middleware enabled.

If you are not already using middleware you need to add the following to your `astro.config.mjs`:

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'

// https://astro.build/config
export default defineConfig({
  experimental: {
    middleware: true
  },
  output: 'server'
})
```

In your Astro project create a file `src/middleware.ts` if you don't have one already. Then add the following code:

```jsx harmony
import {sequence} from "astro/middleware"
import {astroErrorPages} from "error-pages"

export const onRequest = sequence(astroErrorPages())
```

## Basic Usage

By default, the custom error pages live in your `/pages/error-pages` directory.
You can change this by passing a config object to the middleware. See the [Configuration](/config/configuration) section for more information
on how you can configure the middleware.

If a server response with a status code of 400 or above is encountered, the user will be redirected to the corresponding error page.
So a 404 response will redirect to `/error-pages/404`, a 500 response will redirect to `/error-pages/500`, etc.

You can customize these pages however you want.
